<aside class="notes">
Walter Elias &quot;Walt&quot; Disney was born on December 5, 1901, in Chicago. As a kid, he began drawing, painting and selling pictures to neighbors and family friends. When Disney was in high school, he took drawing and photography classes and was a contributing cartoonist for the school paper. At night, he took courses at the Chicago Art Institute. Disney dropped out of school when he was 16 to join the Army but was rejected for being underage. Instead, he joined the Red Cross and was sent to France for a year to drive an ambulance.

<aside class="notes">
<p>Disney worked at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, where he made commercials based on cutout animation. Around this time, he began experimenting with a camera, doing hand-drawn cel animation, and decided to open his own animation business. From the ad company, he recruited Fred Harman as his first employee. &lt;&gt;</p>

<aside class="notes">
Walt and Harman made a deal with a local Kansas City theater to screen their cartoons, which they called Laugh-O-Grams. The cartoons were hugely popular, and Disney was able to acquire his own studio, upon which he bestowed the same name. Laugh-O-Gram hired a number of employees, including a fellow cartoonist he had previously worked with, Ub Iwerks. They did a series of seven-minute fairy tales that combined both live action and animation, which they called Alice in Cartoonland. By 1923, however, the studio had become burdened with debt, and Disney was forced to declare bankruptcy.

<aside class="notes">
Disney and his brother Roy soon pooled their money and moved to Hollywood. Iwerks also relocated to California, and there the three began the Disney Brothers' Studio. Their first deal was with New York distributor Margaret Winkler, to distribute their Alice cartoons. They also invented a character called Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and contracted the shorts at $1,500 each.

<aside class="notes">
A few years later, Disney discovered that Winkler and her husband, Charles Mintz, had stolen the rights to Oswald, along with all of Disneyâ€™s animators, except for Iwerks. Right away the Disney brothers, their wives and Iwerks produced three cartoons featuring a new character Walt had been developing called Mickey Mouse. The first animated shorts were silent films, which failed to find distribution. With Walt as the voice of Mickey, the cartoon was an instant sensation.

	</p>
<aside class="notes">
During the next five years, Walt Disney Studios completed Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo and Bambi. During the mid-1940s, Disney created &quot;packaged features,&quot; groups of shorts strung together to run at feature length due to a strike by Disney animators in 1941. By 1950, he was once again focusing on animated features. Cinderella was released in 1950, followed by a live-action film called Treasure Island, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp, Sleeping Beauty and 101 Dalmatians. In all, more than 100 features were produced by his studio.

Disney's $17 million Disneyland theme park opened on July 17, 1955, in Anaheim, California, with actor (and future U.S. president) Ronald Reagan presiding over the activities on what was once an orange grove. Disneyland has expanded its rides over time and branched out globally with parks in Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.

<aside class="notes">
Within a few years of the opening, Disney began plans for a new theme park and Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow in Florida. Disney died while the theme park was still under construction in 1966 due to lung cancer. Following his death, his brother carried on the plans to finish the Florida theme park, which opened in 1971 under the name Walt Disney World.
